# Web3 Smart Contract and Backend Development Training Plan

## Program Overview

This comprehensive training program is designed to transform participants into skilled web3 developers capable of handling real-world client projects. The curriculum takes a progressive approach, starting with familiar EVM-based development and transitioning to Solana's unique programming model.

**Phase 1** provides participants with a solid foundation in EVM development through building a full-stack dapp on Base L2. Students will learn the complete development lifecycle from smart contract creation to frontend integration, gaining hands-on experience with Solidity, The Graph, and React.js. This phase ensures participants understand the fundamental concepts of web3 development.

**Phase 2** introduces participants to Solana's ecosystem by migrating the coin flip contract from EVM to Solana. This transition helps students understand the key differences between blockchain architectures and provides practical experience with Rust programming and Solana's account model. Students will learn how to adapt their EVM knowledge to Solana's unique programming paradigms.

**Phase 3** deepens participants' Solana expertise through the complex migration of Uniswap V2 from EVM to Solana. This challenging project covers advanced topics including automated market makers (AMMs), liquidity pools, and DeFi protocols. Students will master Solana's parallel execution model and program-derived addresses while building production-ready smart contracts.

Upon completion of this training program, participants will be well-equipped to work on professional web3 projects, with expertise spanning multiple blockchain ecosystems and the ability to architect, develop, and deploy complex decentralized applications.
