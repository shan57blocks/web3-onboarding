## Phase 2: Solana Version of Coin Flip (8 days)

Implementing a Solana version of the Coin Flip dapp.

1. **Solana Fundamentals**

   - Install Solana CLI tools and Rust
   - Set up Solana development environment
   - Learn Solana program architecture and accounts model

2. **Smart Contract Development**

   - Rewrite EtherCoinFlip as a Solana program using Rust
   - Implement program logic with Solana's account structure
   - Handle coin flip game states using Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)
   - Deploy to Solana devnet

3. **Client Integration**

   - Implement a nodejs script or Dapp for users to interact with the contract

### Testing and Extensions

1. **Testing and Optimization**

   - Write comprehensive tests for both implementations
   - Compare gas costs/transaction fees between platforms
   - Optimize for lower costs and better performance

### Acceptance Criteria

Upon completion of Phase 2, participants must organize a meeting to demonstrate their achievements through the following:

1. **Code Review Meeting**

   - Organize and present a comprehensive review meeting to showcase the completed Solana coin flip implementation
   - Present the working Solana program with deployed contract on devnet
   - Demonstrate the client application (Node.js script or dApp) interacting with the contract
   - Walk through the code architecture and explain key Solana concepts implemented

2. **Technical Demonstration**

   - Show live interaction with the deployed contract
   - Explain the account model and PDA usage in the implementation
   - Present test results and performance comparisons
   - Discuss challenges faced and solutions implemented

3. **Documentation Review**
   - Present clear documentation of the setup process
   - Provide deployment instructions and testing procedures
   - Share lessons learned and key differences between Ethereum and Solana development
